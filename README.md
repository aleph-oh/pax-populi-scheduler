This app uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (using [Mongoose](mongoosejs.com)), [Express.js](expressjs.com), [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/), and [handlebars](handlebarsjs.com) templating.

To run this locally, make sure you have Node and MongoDB installed on your machine. Start a mongo server in one terminal. Next, in a separate terminal, enter the directory housing the app, and run `npm install` to install the required node packages. Additionally, make sure you have [bower](https://bower.io/) and run `bower install` to install all the required javascript packages.
 
To start the app, run `npm start` (or `node app.js`). The app will be available on [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).
